# üí´ About Me:
This is my bionic hand project that I have been working on for a couple of years. I have completed a lot of the research and theoretical design. I have completed the CAD and PCB design, there are images below:<br>The goals of the project is to build a working prototype; grow my CAD, mechanical, electrical, and software design skills. The frameworks that I am using are Fusion, Unity, and Python.<br>I have studied the bio-mechanics and anatomy of the fingers, palm, and wrist to understand their coordinated movement. Should be able to preform 6 grip types and thumb-to-fingertip actions.<br>The CAD design for wrist, palm, and finger subsystems has been completed as well as the PCB design for the potentiometers and servo motor connections.<br>The future work included the completion of the the 3D printing and acquiring the other parts. <br>
