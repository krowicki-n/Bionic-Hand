Here is my bionic hand project that I have been working on for a few years. I have finished the CAD and the PCB design and below are the images: <p>
Goals: Build a working prototype; grow my CAD, mechanical, electrical,
and software design skills. Using Fusion, Unity, Python <p>
• Research: Studied the bio-mechanics and anatomy of the fingers, palm,
and wrist to understand their coordinated movement. Should be able to
preform 6 grip types and thumb-to-fingertip actions.<p>
• Completed: CAD design for wrist, palm, and finger subsystems. PCB
design for potentiometers and servo motor connections.<p>
• Future Work: Complete 3D printing and acquire materials. Build and test
the prototype<p>
